# Carousel Compose

The open source project is implement the new Carousel with Material 3 with Jetpack Compose and shows
two example, `HorizontalUncontainedCarousel` and `HorizontalMultiBrowseCarousel`.

# The Project Contain the following technologies

[Carousel Material 3 Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/carousel/package-summary)
refers to a horizontally scrollable list that allows users to swipe through content such as images
or cards. It is part of the Material Design system and integrates well with Composeâ€™s declarative UI
approach. <br />
The programming language is the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html), it is a
modern, JVM-based programming language that is concise, safe, and interoperable with Java. <br />
[Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) is used for asynchronous
tasks. <br />
[Kotlin KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) is a collection of Kotlin extensions that
offer more concise and expressive code for working with Android APIs and libraries.
The UI is build using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose). <br />
[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) is responsible for making requests and retrieving
data from the remote server. ([Repository](https://github.com/square/retrofit)) <br />
[Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) is responsible for saving
the retrieved data from the remote server, querying data from the local database, and supporting
offline functionality.  <br />
[KSP](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-ksp) ("Kotlin Symbol Processing") is a tool for
efficient annotation processing in Kotlin, providing faster code generation and symbol manipulation
compared to KAPT. [Repository](https://github.com/google/ksp) <br />
[Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) for Jetpack Compose is a library that it is
responsible for loading the images
asynchronous. ([Coil Documentation](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/), [Repository](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil)) <br />
[Hilt Dependencies Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)
is an Android library that simplifies dependency injection by using annotations to automatically
manage and provide dependencies across components, built on top of
Dagger. ([Documentation](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)) <br />
[MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch) with repository is an
architecture where the Repository manages data sources (e.g., network, database), the ViewModel
processes the data for the UI, and the View displays the UI, ensuring a clear separation of
concerns. <br />
For Navigation between screens is use
the [New Navigation Type Safety](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/navigation-compose-meet-type-safety-e081fb3cf2f8). <br />
[UI State](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/events#handle-viewmodel-events)
to initial, loading, loaded and error. <br />
